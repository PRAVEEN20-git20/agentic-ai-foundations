# Agentic Foundations

This repository covers the fundamentals of AI agents, focusing on **autonomy**, **memory**, and **reasoning** capabilities. The project includes practical implementations demonstrating how to build production-ready agentic AI solutions.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a hands-on learning journey into building AI agents that can:
- 🤖 Make autonomous decisions
- 🧠 Maintain memory and state
- 💭 Reason about context and intent
- 🔒 Operate securely in production environments
